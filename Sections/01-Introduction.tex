\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Data Types}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Numerical/Quantitive, discret: Countable
    
    Example: Number of rejected Loans, classes taken this semster
    \item Numerical/Quantitive, Continuos: Interval data 
    
    Example: Distance, mg of drug taken, size of a house
    \item Categorical, ordinal: distinct and can be ordered
    
    Example: Credit score can be \{low, medium, high\}
    \item Categorical, nominal: categories cannot be orderd
    
    Example: gender, eye color
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Machine Learning Paradigms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unsupervised Learning: Discover and explore structure from unlabelled data
    \item Supervised Learning: Learn to predict/forecast an output of interest, we know what we want to predict and labelled data is available
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Unsupervised Learning}
Tasks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dimensionality reduction
    \item Feature Learning
    \item Matrix compilation
    \item Anomaly detection
    \item Generating data
\end{itemize}

 \subsubsection{Supervised Learning}
 Given a set of features/attributes for some objects and also the ouput/target value of what we want to predict.
 The Supervised ML task: Given a new object and its features what would be the output value:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item Regression: Ouput is a numeric value
    \item Classification: Ouput is a categorical value
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection{Data Preparation/Preprocessing}
 Data will rarly be in the format and quality needed for analytics and model training and several of these operations will be needed:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item Data integration/consolidation: Collects and merges data from multiple sources into coherent data store 
    \item Data cleaning: removing or modifying incorrect data, identify and reduce noise in data
    \item Data transformations: normalize, discretize or aggregate the data
    \item Data reduction: reduce data size by reducing the number of samples or reducing the number of attributes, balance skewed data
 \end{itemize}
 Low quality data will result in low quality results
